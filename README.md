## 💣 What This Is

You’re looking at the world’s first real-time optimization engine for Oncolytic Virotherapy (OV).  
This system converts lab-created OV strains into programmable clinical weapons using:

- 🧬 **Pre-Treatment Immune & Metabolic Priming**  
- ⚡ **Hz-Calibrated Viral Penetration Enhancement**  
- 💀 **PCD-Triggered Metabolic Collapse Post-Infection**  
- 🔁 **Live AI Recalibration of Tumour Response**

This is not a theory. It’s a deployable framework designed for:
- Clinics
- Biotech licensing
- AI-driven therapeutic models

You didn't just design an OV treatment...  
You built the kill switch that weaponizes them. 💀
